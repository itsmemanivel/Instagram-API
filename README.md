# Instagram Feed using API

[Live Demo](https://veluvj.github.io/Instagram-API/)

Get all images from a user's instagram page 

## How it works
Our code uses the Instagram public API to grab all photos from any instagram page (this code uses a profile page, but we can use hashtags too!) It then 
displays them on a webpage.
